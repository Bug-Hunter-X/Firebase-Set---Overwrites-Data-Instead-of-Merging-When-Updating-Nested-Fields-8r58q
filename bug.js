The following code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error in Firebase where data isn't written to the database due to incorrect data structure in a set operation.  The issue arises when attempting to update a nested field within a document using `set()` without properly merging existing data.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage of set()
db.collection('users').doc('userId').set({
  name: 'John Doe',
  address: {
    street: 'New Street',
    city: 'New City'
  }
});

// This will overwrite the entire 'users/userId' document, instead of updating the address field only.
```

In this scenario, if the 'users/userId' document already contains data other than the address, that data will be lost.
